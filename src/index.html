    <h1>What are the different type of rock climbing?</h1>
    <p>Rock climbing consists of three types; bouldering, top rope and lead climbing.

    <h2>Bouldering</h2>
    <p>Bouldering is where no ropes or harness is needed.
        The only equipment need for bouldering is a pair of
        climbing shoes and lots of chalk.
